# Next.js 15 App Router Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Next.js 15 `Link` component within a dynamically rendered component in the app directory.  The `Link` component fails to function correctly, preventing navigation to the specified routes.  The solution provides a workaround for this issue.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe that the links generated by `MyComponent` do not work as expected.

## Solution

The solution involves using the `usePathname` hook to ensure proper routing behavior within dynamically rendered components.
